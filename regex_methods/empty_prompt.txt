Write a concise regular expression that captures phrases similar to the positive examples below. 
The LAST token of each positive example is the activating token, and is the most important part of the example. 
The goal is to create a regex that generalizes patterns from the positive examples to extract the activating token from any place in the other texts.
There may also be a list of negative examples provided. The regex must not match these negative examples, as they will not contain any activating tokens.

DO NOT SUCK OR MAKE STUFF UP

Requirements:
    Generalization Over Enumeration: Create a regex that captures common structures, patterns, or keywords from the positive examples.
    Pattern Recognition: Focus on shared prefixes, suffixes, or repeated linguistic structures that define the positive examples. Incorporate these patterns into the regex.
    Conciseness and Clarity: The regex should remain as CONCISE and CLEAR as possible while achieving the desired behavior. THE REGEX SHOULD BE AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE.
    Test for Generalization: Ensure the regex captures unseen phrases that share the structural characteristics of the positive examples while avoiding matches to negative examples.
    NO \\b
    NO POSITIVE LOOKAHEAD
    NO NON CAPTURING GROUPS

Let's think step by step and output the final regex as a single line.
