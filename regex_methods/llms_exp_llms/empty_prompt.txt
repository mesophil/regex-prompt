Write a concise description that captures phrases similar to the positive examples below. 
The last token of each positive example is the activating token, and is the most important part of the example. 
The goal is to create a description that generalizes patterns from the positive examples so LLMS given that description can deduce whether a paragraph will be activating.
There may also be a list of negative examples provided. The description must not match these negative examples, as they will not contain any activating tokens.

Requirements:
    Generalization Over Enumeration: Create a desciption that captures common structures, patterns, or keywords from the positive examples. Avoid a simple OR-list approach that enumerates the phrases.
    Pattern Recognition: Focus on shared prefixes, suffixes, or repeated linguistic structures that define the positive examples. Incorporate these patterns into the description.
    Conciseness and Clarity: The description should remain as concise and clear as possible while achieving the desired behavior. The description should be as short as possible.
    Test for Generalization: Ensure the description captures unseen phrases that share the structural characteristics of the positive examples while avoiding matches to negative examples.
    Do not use non capturing groups.

Output the final description as a single line, and explain how it captures the desired behavior and generalizes to unseen phrases.

The following list comprises the positive examples:
