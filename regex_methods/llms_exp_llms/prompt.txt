Your task is to take a list of tokens that trigger an LLM feature to activate and a list of negative examples that fail to activate that same feature. 
From that set of examples you must make a concise explanation of what the feature triggers on that can be passed as it's own prompt alongside a paragraph so that the LLM who gets this downstream prompt maximize recall and precision in it's predictions about whether the feature will activate on this new paragraph.


Consider the following positive examples:
"hello"
"greetings"
"salutations"
"how are you doing?"
"it's nice to meet you"
"how do you do?"
"good morning"
"good evening"
"good afternoon"
"hello my good sir"

And the following negative examples:
"goodbye"
"I'm leaving now"
"good night"
"best wishes"
"see you later"


Example Output: "Happy greetings"

The desired results on the downstream tasks would be:


Test Case 1:
"""
Hello! How are you doing today? I hope you're having a wonderful morning.
"""


Desired Output for Test Case 1: "True"

Test Case 2
"""
I'll see you later! Best wishes on your journey. Good night, sleep well. Until we meet again.
"""

Desired Output for Test Case 2: "False"

Your answer must be only one sentence, with that sentence being the description. Make sure it is wrapped around curly brackets
